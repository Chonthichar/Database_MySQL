# Database MySQL
## PetClinic Scenario


This project involves designing a relational database for a PetClinic, covering entities like veterinarians, pets, owners, and appointments. The database is structured with 11 tables to handle information on appointments, treatments, and client details, focusing on minimizing redundancy through normalization. Key features include:

- Entity identification and attribute listing for each relation
- Primary, candidate, and foreign key definitions
- ER diagram for database structure
- SQL DDL and DML scripts for database creation, dummy data population, and complex query execution
- Explanation of ACID properties applied to maintain transaction integrity
- Discussion on the suitability of relational databases over NoSQL for the PetClinic scenario

For full details, including SQL scripts and data schema, please refer to the following files:
